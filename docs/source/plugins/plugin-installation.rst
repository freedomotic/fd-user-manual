Plugin installation
===================

Install manually
----------------
- Go to the [plugin marketplace](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic-plugins-marketplace) and download the package file. The **.device** is a compressed archive so you can extract it simply by using any tool as winzip, winrar or unzip. There are two types of plugins: **devices** and **objects**.
- Extract **"devices"** to FREEDOMOTIC_ROOT/plugins/devices folder.
- Extract **"objects"** to FREEDOMOTIC_ROOT/plugins/objects folder.
- Restart Freedomotic.
