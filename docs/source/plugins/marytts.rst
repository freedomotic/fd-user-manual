MaryTTS Text to Speech
======================

**Description**: Text To Speech plugin based on MaryTTS library

**Developer:** Mauro Cicolella

Overview
--------

This plugin can be used to speak any text when an event occurs. It is completely programmable using the automations system (IF this THEN say THAT).

It's based on **MaryTTS** project (http://mary.dfki.de/project-summary.html).

Configuration
-------------

Automations examples
--------------------

Text to speech plugin comes with these predefined commands which can be attached to a trigger to create an automation (if you don't know how to do read this chapter of the tutorial):

* ``say current time``
* ``say current temperature of the thermometer``
* ``say electric device status``
* ``say door/window status``
* ``say readed motion level``

which can be attached to any trigger to create **automations** like:

* ``if an object is clicked -> say electric device status``
* ``a door becomes open -> say door/window status``

...and so on

How to create new custom commands
---------------------------------

* Right click on an object and switch to **Automations** table
* In command box write ``say current time`` or any other command starting with "say" so you can use it as a template for yours
* Click the edit button. In the next window change the say property according to your needs (remembed you can use token substitution to insert variables like ``@event.object.name``)
* Save as new command

Now your command will be available to be used in automations.

How to install better and natural sounding voices
