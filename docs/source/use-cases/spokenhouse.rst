Requirements
------------

* Freedomotic 5.6.0-rc3

In order to properly connect the smartphone to Freedomotic, during the first access to the application you are required parameters:

* ip address of the machine running Freedomotic
* username and password used to access Freedomotic

The latest addition to Spoken House is the voice control! After activating this mode in the settings by pressing any hardware button volume control, you will be sent a voice command application to handle more comfortably objects in the framework. This mode allows, for the moment, only the on / off or opening / closing of some objects. The typical sentence structure recognized by the application requires a verb as the first word (eg "open" or "turn on") and then the name of the object to be controlled, as well as the name of the room and the floor where is located (complete example: Open the door of the living room of the first floor).
It is a cross platform mobile application that allows people with visual impairments easier management of devices in their home through their home automation control.
