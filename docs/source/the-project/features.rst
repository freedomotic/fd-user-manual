========


**Identity**: All things have a persistent unique identifier. This identifier allows you to address it from all over the world, and it works no matter whichever automation protocol it uses. You are safe from the protocols out there.

**Services**: Freedomotic is different, automation is not the end of the story. The framework is centred around the concept of services for users, which may use automation to achive a goal. It is the Internet of Things at a new level. Think Wider!

**Simulation**: Freedomotic allows you to fully run it without any sensor or actuator connected. You can configure and test your automation before buying the hardware. This is great when planning a system with your customers, give them a taste of the finished product.

**Realtime Marketing**: Freedomotic knows the environment's topology (ie: rooms, shapes and locations), the people andthe things in it. This allows to track the users in the environment, profile them and create 1 to 1 realtime marketing campains. This feature is also great for disabled assistance and security focused systems.

**Cross language Restful API**: you can control any aspect of the system with our JSON based RESTful APIs, from listing and controlling the objects in an environment, to retrieve, install and manage plugins, all using familiar and developer friendly technologies. The entire system is event based. Components dialog toghether using text, events and commands, so it's easy to integrate your ERP, CRM or any legacy software you already run on your own premises. This is also great to build custom branded frontends for the web, mobile and desktop. In Freedomotic you can run concurrently as many frontends as you want, each one can be targeted to a specific audience.

**Distributed**: Freedomotic can be run as a decentralized peer to peer network with no single point of failure. It can be deployed on a network of embedded systems like Raspberry Pi or on standard PCs and servers. For businesses this means you can have an instance running in the cloud connected to different satellites. You can manage the configuration and provide unique compute intensive features in the cloud (eg: face recognition) for a montly fee.

**Plugins**: The system features are not hardcoded. You can install new plugins at runtime enriching the features. If you are interested in plugins development take a look at our Developers - Getting Started tutorial. Any plugin can be uploaded to an online marketplace (our or your own) to allow 1-click installation.

**Auto discovery**: Wouldn't it be great if you can turn on a light and have it automatically configured on the virtual environment map? Freedomotic can autodiscover the objects (eg: home automation devices) deployed in your real environment. No more diving into complex configuration files.

**History aware**: it can track any status change in the environment and update them in a database for analysis. You can analyze consumption behaviors to implement real energy saving or learn more about how your customers interact with your business, for example their visit patterns.

**Secure, Multilanguage and Multiuser**: Freedomotic is built from the ground up with multilanguage, multiuser and security features in mind. All these features come free of cost for each new plugin you develop, sparing a lot of time and effort. You can focus on your core business and let Freedomotic do the heavy lifting.
