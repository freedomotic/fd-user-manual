Project History
===================

The Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI) at the University of Trento had several research
teams working on sensor networks for home monitoring and automation.

They needed a **framework** capable of easily integrating different projects developed in heterogeneous languages. This
framework needed to make those projects work together, help simplify testing, and produce visual demos to show to
research partners. Using a common framework, teams at DISI could focus on the core of their research instead of
developing custom solutions for each individual project. The **Freedomotic** project was created to fulfill these needs.

The main goals and requirement of **Freedomotic** were: maintain a framework which was flexible and modular which could
be easily integrated and adapted to different (and potentially unknown) needs, allowed for simple testing, and could
produce visual demos. 

These same goals and requirements continue to hold true today.
