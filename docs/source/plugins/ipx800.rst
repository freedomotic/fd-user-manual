Overview
--------


Configuration
-------------

The *ipx800-manifest.xml* file contains all the plugin configuration parameters. It's possible to control more than one board setting its parameters into a specific ``<tuple></tuple>`` block.

Here an example of configuration file:

.. code:: xml 

  <config>
     <properties>
        <property name="description"    value="Communicates with ipx800 board"/>
        <property name="protocol.name"  value="ipx800"/>
        <property name="category"       value="protocol"/>
        <property name="short-name"     value="ipx800"/>
        <property name="address-delimiter" value=":"/>
        <property name="startup-time"   value="on load"/>
        <property name="change-state-relay-url" value="leds.cgi?led="/>
        <property name="send-pulse-relay-url" value="rlyfs.cgi?rlyf="/>
        <property name="get-status-url" value="status.xml"/>
      </properties>
      <tuples>
         <tuple>
            <property name="alias" value="default"/>
            <property name="ip-to-query" value="ip-board"/>
            <property name="port-to-query" value="port-board"/>
            <property name="relay-number" value="8"/>
            <property name="analog-input-number" value="2"/>
            <property name="digital-input-number" value="4"/>
            <property name="starting-relay" value="0"/>
            <property name="led-tag" value="led"/>
            <property name="analog-input-tag" value="analog"/>
            <property name="digital-input-tag" value="btn"/>
          </tuple>
      </tuples>
   </config>

For each connected board the parameters are the following

   "port-to-query","yes","any port number e.g. 80","sets the port number"	 
   "relay-number","yes","","number of relays"	 
   "analog-input-number","yes","","number of analog inputs"	 
   "digital-input-number","yes","","number of digital inputs"	 
   "starting-relay","yes","0 or 1","starting number in status.xml"	 
   "led-tag","yes","led","status.xml tag for compatibility with previous versions"
   "analog-input-tag","yes","analog or an","status.xml tag	for compatibility with previous versions"
   "digital-input-tag","yes","btn","status.xml tag for compatibility with previous versions"
 
How to control an object with this board
----------------------------------------

With this board you can control the powered behavior of any electric device in your environment, meaning you can turn on/off electric devices.

For this example we use a light thing:

* Open the file ipx800.xml into *freedomotic/plugins/devices/ipx800* folder and set ip-address and port number of your board
* Right click on the light object in the environment to show its configuration panel
* Change the property **protocol** to **ipx800**
* Change the property "address" to a string composed of **ALIAS:RELAY_NUMBER:led**  where ALIAS is the string used to identify the board, RELAY_NUMBER is the relay on which your object is connected (from 1 to 8 the maximum number of supported  relays) and led is used to retrieve the relay state from status.xml file.  An example address can be "default:1:led" this identifies the first relay on a board listening on port 80 of the http URL 192.168.201.10
* Under **turn on** (in **Actions**) select the command called ``Turn on Relay on Ipx800 board``
* Under **turn off** (in **Actions**) select the command called ``Turn off Relay on Ipx800 board``. Now the plugin is able to read any relay status change and update the object one.
* Under **powered** (in **Data Sources**) select the command called ``IPX800 board reads a state change``
