Spoken House
============

**Spoken House** is a mobile app for users with impaired vision and / or hearing developed in collaboration between
Informatici senza Frontiere and the University of Sannio.

This cross platform mobile application allows people with visual impairments easier management of their home
automation controlled devices.

Using the 4 corners of the device and electronic voice guidance allows easy use and an easy navigation within the
application.

    Spoken House

Features
--------

* Interface divided into 4 equal parts, each corresponding to a corner of the device
* Increase or decrease the font size of text displayed
* Change the default theme with other combinations of colors (such as high contrast)
* Electronic voice to aid in navigation
* Encoding of messages to Morse Code through device vibration
* Encoding of messages marked to Italian
* View the video application help in sign language
* Voice control to change the state of objects in the house

Requirements
------------

* Freedomotic 5.6.0-rc3

To connect the smartphone to Freedomotic, during the first launch of the application you are required to provide the
following parameters:

* IP Address of the machine running Freedomotic
* Username and Password used to access Freedomotic

Voice Control
-------------

The latest addition to Spoken House is the voice control! After activating this mode in settings (which is accessed by
pressing any hardware button such as the volume control buttons), you will be sent a voice command application to more
comfortably control objects in Freedomotic.

Currently the voice control mode only allows for controlling devices with "on" / "off" or by "opening" / "closing" of
various objects.

The typical sentence structure recognized by the application requires a verb as the first word (eg "open" or "turn on")
and then the name of the object to be controlled followed by the name of the room and the floor where is located. A
complete example would be: "Open the door of the living room of the first floor."
